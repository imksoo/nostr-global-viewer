# Simple Nostr Client with Vue 3

This web page is a simple and interactive Nostr client built using Vue 3, allowing users to view and explore events from various relays. By connecting to relay-jp.nostr.wirednet.jp (this is my relay), the page displays a list of events sorted by their creation date, along with the author's display name, username, and a link to their Nostr profile.

Users can also view each event's content and a direct link to the event on nostx.shino3.net. With real-time updates and a clean, easy-to-navigate interface, this web page offers a convenient way to stay informed and engaged with the Nostr network.
